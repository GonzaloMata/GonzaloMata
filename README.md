- 👋 Hi, I’m @GonzaloMata
- 🏆 My main goal is to make a positive impact on society by creating technology that will help people live better lives. I'm incredibly passionate about creating technology and make ideas a real thing
     
- 🌱 I'm eager to constantly learn. "My comfort zone" is not being comfortably doing my thing. I'm always looking for challenges. If I don't know the answer of something, I will tell you the truth (that I don't know 🤷🏻‍♂️) and I'll learn what I need to, to come back and give you the answer

  - I’m currently learning how to be more proeficent in python, OpenCV and Tkinter library, working on personal projects and life goals while I'm still delivering my 110% in my 9-5 job (Building and testing drones at Amazon Prime Air!).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to health (prosthetics, cerebral palsy), robotics, authonomous vehicles and automotive industry! (I'm a huge F1 fan 🏎 )
